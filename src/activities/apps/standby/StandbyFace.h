// calendar, etc.). One Face is active at a time; StandbyActivity owns it via
// unique_ptr and switches between faces in response to Left/Right input.
//
// Virtual dispatch is used (rather than std::function or templates) because each
// Face is allocated once per session and called a handful of times per frame;
// the vtable cost is negligible compared to the indirection it removes from
// StandbyActivity.

  // invocations produce the same picture.

  // (sw, sh)` predicate declared in StandbyActivity.cpp's face table. Faces
  // themselves don't need to know about screen dimensions or orientation.
