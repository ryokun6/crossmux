Covers routing through the HAL (HalStorage / HalGPIO / HalDisplay) instead of raw SDK classes, MappedInputManager logical buttons instead of raw GPIO indices, UITheme/GUI for all rendering, the singleton macros, tr() for user-facing text, and where a new abstraction boundary belongs.

# HAL and Abstractions

CLAUDE.md lists the HAL classes and the SdFat-concurrency reason they exist.
This is when and how to route through them, and where to draw a new boundary.

## Route through the layer, always

- **SD card I/O:** `Storage` (HalStorage) and `HalFile`. Never `SdFat`,
  `FsFile`, `SdSpiCard`, `FsBaseFile`, or `SDCardManager` directly. The HAL
  serializes every SD access through one mutex; bypassing it races the SPI state
  machine and panics FreeRTOS (CLAUDE.md has the failure mode). This is a
  correctness boundary, not a style preference.
- **Display:** `HalDisplay` over `EInkDisplay`. **Input:** `HalGPIO` over
  `InputManager`.
- **Rendering:** everything through the `GUI` macro (UITheme) and the renderer's
  oriented metrics. No hardcoded fonts, colors, coordinates, or 800/480
  literals; ask the renderer for width/height and use the oriented viewable
  area.
- **Input in activities:** `MappedInputManager::Button` logical enums
  (`Button::Confirm`, `Button::PageForward`, ...). Never raw `HalGPIO::BTN_*`
  indices outside `ButtonRemapActivity`. Logical buttons survive user remapping
  and orientation; raw indices do not.
- **Shared state:** the singleton macros (`SETTINGS`, `APP_STATE`, `GUI`,
  `Storage`, `I18N`), not threaded pointers.

## Preserve Input Ownership

For edge selection, long presses, or Activity/popup transitions, read
[`docs/engineering/ui-and-input.md`](../../../docs/engineering/ui-and-input.md).
Trace the logical button through the originating owner, child or popup, result
callback, and resumed owner. Identify every `wasPressed()`, `wasReleased()`,
and `isPressed()` consumer.

- Normal Activities read the shared input snapshot; they do not call
  `mappedInput.update()`.
- Assign one owner and one semantic action to each physical gesture.
- If ownership changes while a button is held, initialize a release barrier
  from `isPressed()` and return through the release frame.
- If a long-press action fires, consume its release.
- Keep a local boolean barrier until repeated cases demonstrate a need for a
  shared abstraction.

## User-facing text

Every string a user reads goes through `tr(STR_*)`. Add the key to the English
YAML, regenerate with `scripts/gen_i18n.py`, then use the `StrId`. Log lines
(`LOG_*`) stay hardcoded.

## Drawing a new boundary

When you need an SDK capability the HAL does not expose yet, **add the method to
the HAL; do not reach around it.** The new method inherits the mutex, logging,
and error contract the rest of the HAL carries. A one-off direct SDK call in an
activity is exactly the layering violation the mutex discipline cannot tolerate.

Keep abstractions thin. A wrapper that only renames an SDK call without adding
the mutex, logging, or an error contract is dead weight. Add a layer only when
it carries one of those contracts or hides a real implementation choice.

## Self-review

- [ ] No direct SdFat / FsFile / SDCardManager / EInkDisplay / InputManager use
      outside `lib/hal`.
- [ ] File access uses `HalFile`; no `.close()` on a local handle
      (DESTRUCTOR_CLOSES_FILE); members closed in `onExit`.
- [ ] Input uses `MappedInputManager::Button`, not raw `BTN_*` indices.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- [ ] One physical gesture produces one action across Activity/popup boundaries.
- [ ] Held buttons are gated and the release frame is consumed; touch remains
      unaffected when no physical button is held.
- [ ] Normal Activities do not update input; a long press consumes its release.
=======
>>>>>>> upstream/master
- [ ] Rendering goes through GUI/UITheme and oriented metrics; no 800/480 or
      hardcoded fonts/coords.
- [ ] User-facing strings use `tr(STR_*)`; new keys added to YAML and
      regenerated.
- [ ] Any new SDK capability is exposed as a HAL method, not called inline.
