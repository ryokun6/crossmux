Two Chinese release envs share `-DENABLE_CHINESE_VERSION` and add a locale axis:

| Env | Locale | UI strings | Fonts | Glyph remap | OTA asset | Version suffix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gh_release_tc` | `zh-TW` | Traditional (`chinese.yaml`) | GenSen TW → `notosans_cjk_*.h` | SC→TC (`ScToTcRemap.h`) | `firmware-tc.bin` | `-tc` |
| `gh_release_sc` | `zh-CN` | Traditional YAML → OpenCC **tw2sp** (TW terms → Mainland Simplified) at gen_i18n | GenSen TW → `notosans_sc_*.h` (SC-keyed subset; same `notosans_cjk_*` symbols) | TC→SC (`TcToScRemap.h`) | `firmware-sc.bin` | `-sc` |

`CHINESE_UI_SIMPLIFIED` is set only on SC envs. International (`gh_release`) has
neither flag.

The `-DENABLE_CHINESE_VERSION` flag in [platformio.ini](../../platformio.ini)
gates every Chinese-only resource:

| Resource | Behavior under ENABLE_CHINESE_VERSION |
|---|---|
| i18n string table (`gen_i18n.py`) | Emits **EN + ZH_TW** (TC) or synthesizes **EN + ZH_CN** via OpenCC **tw2sp** from the same Taiwan-terminology `chinese.yaml` when `CHINESE_UI_SIMPLIFIED` is set (檔案→文件, 網路→网络, …). Persisted codes are BCP47 `zh-TW` / `zh-CN` (`_locale`). |
| Built-in fonts ([lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/all.h](../../lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/all.h)) | Latin headers skipped. Six per-size CJK headers — TC files `notosans_cjk_*.h` or SC files `notosans_sc_*.h` — raw 2-bit bitmaps. Coverage tiers: 8/10/12pt ~3500 common; 14pt ~7000 + symbols; 16/18pt i18n-only. |
| `src/main.cpp` font globals | Each Latin `EpdFont`/`EpdFontFamily` aliases the matching-size CJK symbol (`notosans_cjk_*`). Bold/italic share Regular. |
| EPUB / TXT layout ([lib/Epub/Epub/ParsedText.cpp](../../lib/Epub/Epub/ParsedText.cpp), [CjkKinsoku.h](../../lib/Epub/Epub/CjkKinsoku.h), [TxtReaderActivity.cpp](../../src/activities/reader/TxtReaderActivity.cpp)) | CJK punctuation rules (行頭/行末/分離 禁则) for EPUB horizontal lines and vertical-rl columns, plus TXT horizontal wrap; full-width padding on EPUB. |
| Activities (`src/activities/apps/weread/`) | Compiled in via `build_src_filter`. |
| First-boot language | `Language::ZH_TW` or `Language::ZH_CN` by SKU; international defaults to `EN`. |

**Flash budget** (default `partitions.csv`, dual A/B app slot = 6.25 MB) — each Chinese SKU separately:

| Section | Bytes |
|---|---|
| Code + non-font data | ~3.0 MB |
| 3 CJK font headers 8/10/12pt | ~1.1 MB |
| 1 CJK font header 14pt | ~1.43 MB |
| 2 CJK font headers 16/18pt | ~400 KB |
| i18n strings (EN + one Chinese) | ~16 KB |
| **Total** | **~6.05 MB / 6.25 MB (~92.3%)**, ~500 KB headroom |

A/B OTA rollback works exactly like the Latin build — the firmware fits in
both app slots, and a failed update can auto-revert.

The CN build keeps two size strategies stacked together to land in that
budget:

1. **`-flto=auto`** in `[env:gh_release_tc]` / `[env:gh_release_sc]`. Saves ~140 KB on `.text` via
   cross-TU dead-code elimination. The framework's default `-fno-lto`
   linker flag is stripped via `build_unflags` so the linker plugin
   picks up LTO IR in project objects; pre-built framework `.a` libs
   stay non-LTO and the GCC linker plugin handles the mix. `-Oz` was
   tested and produced byte-identical output to the framework's default
   `-Os` on this codebase, so it is *not* enabled (would only add
   configuration complexity).
2. **Per-size CJK character coverage** in `build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh`
   (see "Regenerating the CJK fonts" below). 8/10/12pt carry the small
   ~3500-char UI subset; **14pt carries the reader-default 7000 通用汉字
   subset plus extended symbol ranges**; 16/18pt carry an i18n-only subset
   (~700 chars from `chinese.yaml`). The tiering keeps the heavy 7000-char
   bitmap to a single point size and shrinks 16/18pt to i18n-only,
   saving ~1 MB vs running the full 7000-char subset at every size.

## Regenerating the CJK fonts

```bash
# 1. (One-time) install build deps into a venv
python3 -m venv /tmp/cn_font_venv
/tmp/cn_font_venv/bin/pip install -r lib/EpdFont/scripts/requirements.txt

# 2. Place GenSenRounded2TW-R.otf into the source dir (gitignored).
#    Source: https://github.com/ButTaiwan/gensen-font (or your licensed copy)
cp /path/to/GenSenRounded2TW-R.otf lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/source/GenSenRounded2TW/

# 3. (Optional) regenerate the character lists. build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh
#    calls this for you in Step 0 unless SKIP_CHARSET=1 is set.
#    Writes BOTH cn_common_chars.txt (top-N + require-from) and
#    cn_i18n_chars.txt (require-from only — drives the 16/18pt subset).
PYTHON=/tmp/cn_font_venv/bin/python3 \
  python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/build_cn_charset.py \
    --require-from lib/I18n/translations/chinese.yaml

# 4. Generate the 6 per-size CJK headers (TC and/or SC — same GenSen OTF)
PYTHON=/tmp/cn_font_venv/bin/python3 \
  bash lib/EpdFont/scripts/build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh
PYTHON=/tmp/cn_font_venv/bin/python3 \
  bash lib/EpdFont/scripts/build-sc-builtin-fonts.sh

# 5. Build
pio run -e gh_release_tc
# or
pio run -e gh_release_sc
```

`build_cn_charset.py` prints the highest-frequency casualties (chars just
above and below the cutoff) so you can verify the trim looks reasonable.

## Force-including feature-specific glyphs

Each feature that needs CJK glyphs absent from both the 3500 SC pool *and*
the natural `chinese.yaml` STR_ values ships a small dedicated text file and
adds it to the `REQUIRE_FROM` array in
[build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh](../../lib/EpdFont/scripts/build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh).
`build_cn_charset.py --require-from <file>` regex-scans the file for every
CJK Unified Ideograph (`[一-鿿]`) and force-includes them in **both**
`cn_common_chars.txt` (8/10/12pt) and `cn_i18n_chars.txt` (16/18pt) —
so glyphs added via this mechanism render at every CN font size. The
14pt tier draws from the static `chars_7000_common.txt` pool instead and
empirically covers every char force-included by today's `REQUIRE_FROM`
list, so the require-from mechanism does **not** feed the 14pt header.
If you add a `cn_<feature>_chars.txt` containing a glyph outside the 7000
pool, audit it against `chars_7000_common.txt` and extend that pool too
(otherwise the feature will render at 8/10/12/16/18pt but show □ at 14pt).

Current example: [cn_almanac_chars.txt](../../lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_almanac_chars.txt)
holds the chars `ChineseAlmanac.cpp` / `ChineseCalendarFace.cpp` need
beyond the standard pool:

```text
戊庚壬癸寅卯巳酉戌廿蛰闰初七八九十冬腊
```

Pattern when adding a new feature:

1. Create `lib/EpdFont/scripts/cn_<feature>_chars.txt` containing only the
   CJK chars the feature renders that aren't otherwise covered (one line,
   UTF-8, no separators required).
2. Append that path to `REQUIRE_FROM=(... cn_<feature>_chars.txt)` in
   `build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh`.
3. Re-run `bash build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh` and commit the regenerated
   `cn_common_chars.txt`, `cn_i18n_chars.txt`, and six `notosans_cjk_*.h`.

GenSen Rounded TW needs **per-size** metric nudges so Lyra layouts
(hardcoded `itemY+7` for UI_10, `getLineHeight` centering for UI_12 menus)
match Ubuntu-tuned spacing. Defaults in `build-cn-builtin-fonts.sh`:

| Size | `--baseline-adjust` | `--line-height-adjust` | Why |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|-----|
| 8 | -2 | +6 | High ink; match Latin `notosans_8` advanceY 23 |
| 10 | -2 | +7 | High ink; interpolate Latin 8/12 → advanceY 28 |
| 12 | +4 | +9 | Menu was low; match Latin `notosans_12` advanceY 34 |
| 14 | +1 | +11 | Match Latin reader advanceY 40 |
| 16 | +1 | +12 | Match Latin reader advanceY 45 |
| 18 | +1 | +13 | Match Latin reader advanceY 51 |

Override with `CN_BASELINE_ADJUST[_SIZE]` / `CN_LINE_HEIGHT_ADJUST[_SIZE]`.

### Traditional glyphs + Simplified remap

Bitmaps store **Taiwan Traditional** codepoints (OpenCC `s2tw` on the SC pool,
plus `--require-from` chars from `chinese.yaml` preserved verbatim so UI forms
like 啟/為/裡 are not rewritten to HK variants). UI strings in `chinese.yaml`
are Traditional (`_language_name: 繁體中文`); `EpdFont::getGlyph` remaps via
committed `lib/EpdFont/ScToTcRemap.h` (~10 KB, also `s2tw`) so Simplified
EPUB/codepoint input does not need duplicate bitmaps.

Anti-pattern (don't do this): hiding chars in a `#` YAML comment inside
`chinese.yaml` to abuse the regex scanner. It works (build_cn_charset.py
does scan comments) but couples a font detail to the i18n file's structure
and forces `gen_i18n.py` to know about it. Dedicated `cn_*_chars.txt`
files are self-documenting and orthogonal to i18n.

## Expanding character coverage (pool, not --top)

`--top` is capped by the source pool size (`chars_3500_common.txt` has 3500
chars by construction — it is the vendored 教育部《现代汉语常用字表》).
Passing `--top 5000` will fail with `--top is >= pool size`.

To enlarge the renderable character set:

1. **For a handful of specific chars**: add a feature-scoped
   `cn_<feature>_chars.txt` as described above. One-line file + one-line
   append to `REQUIRE_FROM`. No pool expansion needed.
2. **For broad coverage gain** (e.g. classical literature, GB2312 Lv2): drop a
   larger source list into `lib/EpdFont/scripts/` (e.g. a `gb2312_full.txt`
   union of Lv1+Lv2) and point `SOURCE_FILE` in `build_cn_charset.py` at it.
   This is a deliberate Flash-budget decision — every 1000 extra chars adds
   roughly **200 KB** to the 8/10/12/14pt headers combined.

The hard ceiling is the 6.25 MB A/B-OTA slot. Today's headroom is ~1.4 MB,
so a ~7000-char SC+TC pool would still fit, but the upcoming OTA delta
shrinks proportionally.

## Known limitations

- **No bold/italic CJK glyphs**: the bitmaps come from a single GenSenRounded2TW-R subset. UI elements that pass `EpdFontFamily::Style::Bold` render the regular weight under CN.
- **Font-size dropdown affects rendered size**: each reader size (12/14/16/18pt) and UI size (10/12pt) and small font (8pt) has its own bitmap header. Switching size really does swap glyph bitmaps.
- **Rare characters render as □ in reader at SMALL**: the SMALL (12pt) bitmap uses the 3500-char pool, which covers all of modern SC but omits classical / scientific rarities, Traditional Chinese variants, and most niche surnames/place names. MEDIUM (14pt, reader default) now uses the 7000 通用汉字 pool and covers most modern names, place names, and regulated chars from the 2013 通用规范汉字表. Expand SMALL by adding a feature-scoped `cn_<feature>_chars.txt` or by enlarging the pool — see "Expanding character coverage" above. Bumping `--top` alone does nothing.
- **CJK in reader at LARGE/EXTRA_LARGE shows blank** for chars outside the i18n subset — by design, since 16/18pt reader sizes are tuned for English EPUB. Switch to MEDIUM to read Chinese.
- **`FontDecompressor` is bypassed for CJK** by design — bitmaps are stored raw because compressing 6 fonts × ~50 KB groups fragments the heap on boot.
- **UI language codes are `zh-TW` / `zh-CN`**: enum members `ZH_TW` / `ZH_CN`; Traditional YAML is the single Taiwan-terminology source (`_language_name: 繁體中文`); SC UI is synthesized via OpenCC **tw2sp** at gen_i18n.

## Consistency check

After regenerating, confirm the committed bitmap headers match the committed
charset files:
- 8/10/12pt headers should equal `len(cn_common_chars.txt unique CJK) + ~497`
  (ASCII/Latin-1/CJK-punct from `--unicodes`)
- 14pt header should equal `len(chars_7000_common.txt) + ~700`
  (extra ~200 comes from the LARGE tier's added symbol ranges)
- 16/18pt headers should equal `len(cn_i18n_chars.txt) + ~497`

```bash
python3 -c "
import re
for sz, subset in [(8, 'cn_common_chars'),
                   (14, 'chars_7000_common'),
                   (16, 'cn_i18n_chars')]:
    chars = open(f'lib/EpdFont/scripts/{subset}.txt').read()
    n_cjk = len(set(c for c in chars if '一' <= c <= '鿿'))
    hdr = open(f'lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/notosans_cjk_{sz}.h').read()
    n_glyphs = sum(1 for ln in hdr.splitlines() if re.match(r'\s*\{\s*\d+,', ln))
    print(f'{sz}pt: charset CJK={n_cjk}, header glyphs={n_glyphs}, latin/punct ≈ {n_glyphs - n_cjk}')
"
```

If `header glyphs` is significantly larger than the expected delta, the
header is stale (most likely committed from an older/larger charset) — re-run
the regeneration steps.
