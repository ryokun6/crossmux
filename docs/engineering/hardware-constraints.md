# Hardware Constraints & The Resource Protocol

## Development Environment Awareness

**CRITICAL**: Detect the host platform at session start to choose appropriate tools and commands.

### Platform Detection
```bash
# Detect platform (run once per session)
uname -s
# Returns: MINGW64_NT-* (Windows Git Bash), Linux, Darwin (macOS)
```

**Detection Required**: Run `uname -s` at session start to determine platform

### Platform-Specific Behaviors
- **Windows (Git Bash)**: Unix commands, `C:\` paths in Windows but `/` in bash, limited glob (use `find`+`xargs`)
- **Linux/WSL**: Full bash, Unix paths, native glob support

**Cross-Platform Code Formatting**:
```bash
find src -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" | xargs clang-format -i
```

## Platform and Hardware Constraints

### Hardware Specs
* MCU: ESP32-C3 (Single-core RISC-V @ 160MHz)
* RAM: ~380KB usable (VERY LIMITED - primary project constraint)
  * **NO PSRAM**: ESP32-C3 has no PSRAM capability (unlike ESP32-S3)
  * **Single Buffer Mode**: Only ONE 48KB framebuffer (not double-buffered)
* Flash: 16MB (Instruction storage and static data)
* Display: 800x480 E-Ink (Slow refresh, monochrome, 1-2s full update)
  * Framebuffer: 48,000 bytes (800 × 480 ÷ 8)
* Storage: SD Card (Used for books and aggressive caching)

### The Resource Protocol
1. Stack Safety: Limit local function variables to < 256 bytes. The ESP32-C3 default stack is small; use std::unique_ptr or static pools for larger buffers.
2. Heap Fragmentation: Avoid repeated new/delete in loops. Allocate buffers once during onEnter() and reuse them.
3. Flash Persistence: Large constant data (UI strings, lookup tables) MUST be marked static const to stay in Flash (Instruction Bus), freeing DRAM.
4. String Policy: Prohibit std::string and Arduino String in hot paths. Use std::string_view for read-only access and snprintf with fixed char[] buffers for construction.
5. UI Strings: All user-facing text must use the `tr()` macro (e.g., `tr(STR_LOADING)`) for i18n support. Never hardcode UI strings directly. For the avoidance of doubt, logging messages (LOG_DBG/LOG_ERR) can be hardcoded, but user-facing text must use `tr()`.
6. `constexpr` First: Compile-time constants and lookup tables must be `constexpr`, not just `static const`. This moves computation to compile time, enables dead-branch elimination, and guarantees flash placement. Use `static constexpr` for class-level constants.
7. `std::vector` Pre-allocation: Always call `.reserve(N)` before any `push_back()` loop. Each growth event allocates a new block (2×), copies all elements, then frees the old one — three heap operations that fragment DRAM. When the final size is unknown, estimate conservatively.
8. SPIFFS Write Throttling: Never write a settings file on every user interaction. Guard all writes with a value-change check (`if (newVal == _current) return;`). Progress saves during reading must be debounced — write on activity exit or every N page turns, not on every turn. SPIFFS sectors have a finite erase cycle limit.
9. `new` is not nothrow on ESP32: With `-fno-exceptions`, bare `new` that fails calls `abort()` — it does NOT return `nullptr`. Always use `new (std::nothrow)` and null-check the result, or use `makeUniqueNoThrow<T>()` from `lib/Memory/Memory.h`. Never write bare `new` for any fallible allocation.
