# ESP32-C3 Platform Pitfalls

> Deep reference for [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). These are RISC-V / flash-cache /
> toolchain hazards that fault silently — each rule below maps to a real crash class.

## `std::string_view` and Null Termination
`string_view` is *not* null-terminated. Passing `.data()` to any C-style API (`drawText`, `snprintf`, `strcmp`, SdFat file paths) is undefined behaviour when the view is a substring or a view of a non-null-terminated buffer.

**Rule**: `string_view` is safe only when passing to C++ APIs that accept `string_view`. For any C API boundary, convert explicitly:
```cpp
// WRONG - undefined behaviour if view is a substring:
renderer.drawText(font, x, y, myView.data(), true);

// CORRECT - guaranteed null-terminated:
renderer.drawText(font, x, y, std::string(myView).c_str(), true);

// CORRECT - for short strings, use a stack buffer:
char buf[64];
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%.*s", (int)myView.size(), myView.data());
```

## `IRAM_ATTR` and Flash Cache Safety
All code runs from flash via the instruction cache. During SPI flash operations (OTA write, SPIFFS commit, NVS update) the cache is briefly suspended. Any code that can execute during this window — ISRs in particular — must reside in IRAM or it will crash silently.

```cpp
// ISR handler: must be in IRAM
void IRAM_ATTR gpioISR() { ... }

// Data accessed from IRAM_ATTR code: must be in DRAM, never a flash const
static DRAM_ATTR uint32_t isrEventFlags = 0;
```

**Rules**:
- All ISR handlers: `IRAM_ATTR`
- Data read by `IRAM_ATTR` code: `DRAM_ATTR` (a flash-resident `static const` will fault)
- Normal task code does **not** need `IRAM_ATTR`

## ISR vs Task Shared State
`xSemaphoreTake()` (mutex) **cannot** be called from ISR context — it will crash. Use the correct primitive for each communication direction:

| Direction | Correct primitive |
|---|---|
| ISR → task (data) | `xQueueSendFromISR()` + `portYIELD_FROM_ISR()` |
| ISR → task (signal) | `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()` + `portYIELD_FROM_ISR()` |
| Task → task | `xSemaphoreTake()` / mutex |
| Simple flag (single writer ISR) | `volatile bool` + `portENTER_CRITICAL_ISR()` |

## RISC-V Alignment
ESP32-C3 faults on unaligned multi-byte loads. Never cast a `uint8_t*` buffer to a wider pointer type and dereference it directly. Use `memcpy` for any unaligned read:

```cpp
// WRONG — faults if buf is not 4-byte aligned:
uint32_t val = *reinterpret_cast<const uint32_t*>(buf);

// CORRECT:
uint32_t val;
memcpy(&val, buf, sizeof(val));
```

This applies to all cache deserialization code and any raw buffer-to-struct casting. `__attribute__((packed))` structs have the same hazard when accessed via member reference.

## Template and `std::function` Bloat
Each template instantiation generates a separate binary copy. `std::function<void()>` adds ~2–4 KB per unique signature and heap-allocates its closure. Avoid both in library code and any path called from the render loop:

```cpp
// Avoid — heap-allocating, large binary footprint:
std::function<void()> callback;

// Prefer — zero overhead:
void (*callback)() = nullptr;

// For member function + context (common activity callback pattern):
struct Callback { void* ctx; void (*fn)(void*); };
```

When a template is necessary, limit instantiations: use explicit template instantiation in a `.cpp` file to prevent the compiler from generating duplicates across translation units.

## ArduinoJson v7: `| 0` / `| 0u` is strict
`JsonVariant::operator|(int)` in ArduinoJson v7 returns the *default* whenever the variant holds a value of a different underlying type — including a number stored as `double`. Many JSON producers (including the WeRead agent gateway) emit numerics as doubles: a Unix timestamp as `1.734600517e9`, a rating as `80.0`. Reading those via `| 0` / `| 0u` silently yields 0 with no error.

```cpp
// WRONG — returns 0 whenever the JSON value is stored as double:
uint32_t createTime = doc["createTime"] | 0u;
int starPercent    = doc["star"]       | 0;

// CORRECT — read as double, then cast to the integer target:
uint32_t createTime = static_cast<uint32_t>(doc["createTime"] | 0.0);
int starPercent     = static_cast<int>(doc["star"]            | 0.0);
```

Apply this to every numeric field on any network-parsed JSON. Strings (`| ""`) and booleans are unaffected.
